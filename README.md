# GradiatorJS

GradiatorJS is a deep learning javascript framework for training Neural Networks directly in your browser. 
This is done with a pedagogical intention in mind, however, you can still use this library in your own projects using gradiatorjs.min.js. 

It implements backpropagation over a DAG(an autograd engine) with a library built on it. You can use this library to perform operations on elemental scalar values OR train CNNs that process images, and anything in between.
